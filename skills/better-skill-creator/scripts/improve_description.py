"""Improve a skill description based on eval results.

Takes eval results (from run_eval.py) and generates an improved description
by calling `claude -p` as a subprocess (same auth pattern as run_eval.py —
uses the session's Claude Code auth, no separate ANTHROPIC_API_KEY needed).

That call is bounded the same way a probe is, and for the same reason: its
prompt embeds the entire SKILL.md body under test, which arrived from wherever
the skill did. `run_eval.SAFE_PERMISSION_MODE` is the default here too, and
`--allow-host-permissions` is the one way past it. Hardening the probes and
leaving this path open would have moved the hole rather than closed it — of the
two `claude -p` launchers in this skill, this was the one with no permission
control at all, and it is also the one that runs in the user's own repository.

    """Run `claude -p` with the prompt on stdin and return the text response.

    Prompt goes over stdin (not argv) because it embeds the full SKILL.md
    body and can easily exceed comfortable argv length.

    ``encoding``/``errors`` are named explicitly. ``text=True``
    alone encodes stdin and decodes stdout with ``locale.getpreferredencoding``,
    which on this project's reference machine is cp1252 -- and the prompt
    carries the *entire* SKILL.md body, so a single em dash or arrow raised
    ``UnicodeEncodeError`` before the child was ever spoken to. Verified:
    ``subprocess.run(text=True, input="... → ...")`` raises "'charmap'
    codec can't encode character '\\u2192'". ``errors="replace"`` on the way back
    keeps a malformed byte on the wire from turning a paid call into a crash.

    ``permission_mode`` resolves through ``run_eval.validate_permission_mode``,
    so ``None`` means the safe mode rather than the host's settings and the one
    spelling that omits the flag is ``inherit``. This call asks for text and
    needs no tool at all, so the mode costs it nothing it uses -- but the mode
    is what stops it *reaching* for one, and this prompt is assembled out of a
    third-party SKILL.md.

    **This call is the looser of the two, and it is worth knowing why.** A probe
    runs with ``cwd`` set to a fresh temp directory and ``--setting-sources
    project,local``. Neither is true here: ``subprocess.run`` below passes no
    ``cwd``, so the child inherits the caller's -- the user's own repository --
    and no ``--setting-sources`` means every scope loads, user settings
    included. Under ``dontAsk`` the allow rules are what still grants, so a
    permissive rule of the user's own is in force here in a way it is not for a
    probe -- as is anything a PreToolUse hook approves.

    What ``SAFE_PERMISSION_MODE`` removes is the unbounded case. What would
    remove most of the rest is the CLI's ``--tools ""``, free for a call that
    uses no tool -- though it "doesn't affect MCP tools", so closing those needs
    ``--disallowedTools "mcp__*"`` as well. It is not passed here because this
    change verified only that the flag parses (``claude --tools "" --help``
    exits 0), never what the resulting session does, and that check costs a
    billed run. Giving this call a temp ``cwd`` and ``--setting-sources`` of its
    own would close the rest. Both are follow-ups rather than part of this
    change.

Skill content (for context on what the skill does):
<skill_content>
{skill_content}
</skill_content>

Based on the failures, write a new and improved description that is more likely to trigger correctly. When I say "based on the failures", it's a bit of a tricky line to walk because we don't want to overfit to the specific cases you're seeing. So what I DON'T want you to do is produce an ever-expanding list of specific queries that this skill should or shouldn't trigger for. Instead, try to generalize from the failures to broader categories of user intent and situations where this skill would be useful or not useful. The reason for this is twofold:

1. Avoid overfitting
2. The list might get loooong and it's injected into ALL queries and there might be a lot of skills, so we don't want to blow too much space on any given description.

Concretely, your description should not be more than about 100-200 words, even if that comes at the cost of accuracy. There is a hard limit of 1024 characters — a description over that fails frontmatter validation and the skill does not load at all, which the user experiences as "it never triggers". It is not truncated. Stay comfortably under the limit.

Here are some tips that we've found to work well in writing these descriptions:
- The skill should be phrased in the imperative -- "Use this skill for" rather than "this skill does"
- The skill description should focus on the user's intent, what they are trying to achieve, vs. the implementation details of how the skill works.
- The description competes with other skills for Claude's attention — make it distinctive and immediately recognizable.
- If you're getting lots of failures after repeated attempts, change things up. Try different sentence structures or wordings.

I'd encourage you to be creative and mix up the style in different iterations since you'll have multiple opportunities to try different approaches and we'll just grab the highest-scoring one at the end.
